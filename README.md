## Sentiment Analysis

Disneyland Park, originally Disneyland, is the first of two theme parks built at the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California, which opened on July 17, 1955. It is the only theme park designed and built under the direct supervision of Walt Disney. It was the property's only attraction. Its official name was changed to Disneyland Park to differentiate it from the expanding complex in the 1990s. It was Disney's first theme park.

There are Disney parks scattered in five places globally; they are located: Florida, California, France, Japan, and Hong Kong. And recently, a new Disney park opened in Shanghai. There is also a Disney Resort and Spa located in Hawaii.
